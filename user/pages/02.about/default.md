# Preface
Hi, my name is Aaron and welcome to my caddy build site. I am a software and electrical engineer, tinkerer and VAG enthusiast. My day job involves software architecting and engineering mostly on the web. I have wanted to own a MK1 pickup since the day a found out they existed (around 17). From that day I have always been trying to find one that wasn't rotted out beyond reasonable salvation or plauged with the "nostalgia price tag". It took me over 10 years but I have finally found one and here I am.
# Purpose of this site
The attempt of this site will be to catalog all of what I learn and do throughout the process of this build. The ultimate goal being to make this information easily accessible to other individuals. I am datanaut and lover of all things information. I enjoy documenting things and sharing that knowledge with other people.
# Goal of the build
I love old cars but also like speed. The goal of this build will be to take a tired ol' VW truck and turn it into a weekend fun missile. I will continue to update this section as it is needed but at the time of&nbsp;writing that includes:
* Engine
  * All integrated engineering bottom end (rods, pistons, bearings, etc.)
  * All integrated engineering bottom end (rods, pistons, bearings, etc.)
  * Overbore of 1mm total on pistons
  * ARP hardware everywhere
  * GEN2 - Garrett GTX3071R Turbo
  * Head work including cams and valves
  * Extra bits that will be listed throughout various log entries
  * 500whp goal (450whp requirement)
* Drivetrain and Suspension
  * O2J TDI Transmission swap
  * Peloquin LSD upgrade
  * Bagged 4 link setup in rear
  * MK1 Front bag kit
  * Airlift 3H management
  * Powerflex bushings everywhere
  * Refreshing/replacing of all stock parts (ball joints, wheel bearings, etc.) 
* Interior
  * Roll cage
  * Custom center console
  * Replacing carpet and headliner
  * New racing seats
  * More to come
  
I'm sure im forgetting some things but feel free to browse around. And don't forget to comment if you have questions on anything and I will attempt to answer as best I can.

# Website architecture details
This site is built with the [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) CMS. If you would like more information you can find the github repo [here](https://github.com/ameeuwsen/caddyfab). By career I am mainly a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)/PHP developer but that was running a bit too slow on my [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) used to host this site.
Grav CMS utilizes a flat file system which makes it extrememly lightweight for any application. With no database and such it is not what I am used to but it runs nice and snappy on my low budget Pi server.
