#Hello!
Well here we are at the first post of this build site.
I don't have too much to say here other than welcome and hope you find this site a useful tool for any cool projects you may be working on.
If you have any questions there is a comment section just like below on each log entry.
The goal of this project is to take a MK1 VW pickup and turn it into a weekend monster. If you want a little more background on exactly what this site is and what the intent is...feel free to visit the about page.
